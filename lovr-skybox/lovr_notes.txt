LOVR Notes:

Possible to get Model:getNodePose in local space - Easy for comparison and manipulation

lovr.math.quat has functions for smooth rotation transations e,g slerp, check it out

https://github.com/bmild/nerf - Photogrammetry with NN, also look for adanerf.
Weâ€™re releasing Implicitron, an extension of PyTorch3D that enables fast prototyping of 3D reconstruction and new-view synthesis methods based on rendering of implicit representations.



FOr water:
Add foam - white color to vertexes that are above some vertical threshold
           also add when close to camera
		   
		   The wave shape can be made to not cover the entire width of the ocean
		   
Did that, but didn't love the feel - maybe cause it wasn't synced with the wave, maybe needs mulitple noises on diff scales 
									Also, the lighting in VR was not right
									
									
SO Environment map is working nice but expensive(no precalculated maps).
The plan to add detail to our water with normal maps needs extra study, so that when add the normals we don't loose the calculated normals
after applying the gerstner waves formula.

New stuff to try

1) Try the raymarch example, thats very cool and provided by bjorn so definitely must be working
2) Maybe switch case approach to new things, like in the same app, try the water shader and the simulations and raymarch stuff
	Main can implement the show the cases in a UI and individual files can implement.
3) Play with the env map implementation, that is so cool I can stay there all day, if it was not so fucking hot or just my general OCD haha
4) Http requests work on pc, check out on app   -  Works sick yo
5) If requests work, implement a poor guitar     -  Started with piano, Got a working piano key in VR with Chuck yuhu
	Client (App) - One String , when plucked gives a strength
	Push over a request to python server
	Which will generate an osc message
	That will be played by Chuck
	
6) Check out pd_chuck repo, to understand how chuck can be embedded
7) Overall the LOVR repo is a gold mine, I dont need to write this down, but its my best resource to relearn C.
8) https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI ParlAI for chitchat in text, might be possible to do audio with COqai tts.
9) Neural Magic's Deepsparse , run models on cpu
