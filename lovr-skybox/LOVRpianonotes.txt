What my current version does?
	Sideeffects = It is laggy, the quiting setup is not good.
	Maybe destroying the colliders seems like a good move, there seems to be some sort of memory leaks
	cause each time I exit the game, the quest home seems laggy and hand tracking gets progressively bad.
	
	Test - If only destroying the physics world during clenaup improves the issue, or something else also needs to be done.

	
	It can play upto 3 notes simultaneously.
	There is option to change locations of the piano
	There is mechanism to change between setup mode and play mode

What needs to be added before I can think of setting up a Sidequest page?
        UI:
		Splash page
		Update graphics
		Chuck setup
		Native samples.
		
		Logic:
		Improve key holding mechanism, a fixed duration after which the note plays again if finger still on it is not a good one.
		Allow for more threads.
		Use of minimal physics colliders
		Other ways to play and not via Chuck i.e. adding note samples.
		
		Nice to have:
		A skybox (e.g a cozy room with a window to the beach or an ocean) - review the lag can be done very early on
		Better hands
		
		Others
		Link to github or ease of setup of the intermediate python server for OSC communications.
		Chuck Scripts.
		*******Audio Visual Effects, some function to map the tunes to a visual something.
		
VERY COOL SIDETOPIC

Looks like a Speech to text model is possible to use with luajit ffi, using Coqui-ai STT models
Very interesting to check out.
It provides a tflite model and client for arm
