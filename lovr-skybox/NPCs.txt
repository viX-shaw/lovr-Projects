New VR thoughts

I guess i am thinking of a pseudo sentient 3d space with animate and inanimate objects.
I want a genetic algorithm to govern the actions of the objects
And I am looking to be awwed from the emergent behaviours.

Requirements

1) I guess just pixels would do, but to keep things visually interesting maybe a bunch of voxel model from that app would work
ultimately visually good less taxing graphics.

2) Apply results from algo after meaningful iterations.
