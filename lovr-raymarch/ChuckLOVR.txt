I have no idea how c or c++ works or their compilation madness
but on the topic of using Chuck with LOVR

there is this
https://github.com/shakfu/pd-chuck

A similar attempt to get chuck core **made available on their releases page https://chuck.stanford.edu/release/files/
to work with PureData

So THE PIANO
Integration works noicely

LOVR -> FLASK -> CHUCK

THings to not forget
1) Run flask as effeciently AS possible when its time
2) Update Chuck to use 10pianos, LOL, maybe logic it up to load when there is a need,
   like let that one note be delayed a little by loading the Piano when more than one fingers are in use
   And also remove pianos when they are not being used, to reduce load on LOVR

3)Thread Code on LOVR to handle all key interactions, might be a little hectic
   I mean on the amount of threads used, ideally 10 threads would be nice to handle each key parallely
   but that might be too much.
